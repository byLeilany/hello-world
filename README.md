-16 years and somewhat days after i'm here-

Hi internet!
My name is Daniela, my life basically consists in having an excess of free time, which sometimes i expend it learning how to code or drawing, but most of the time I'm taking a nap -because sleep is my best pleasure in life-. I love ice creams, and food in general. I'm trying to get better at being productive really, oh and I also like Twitter @byLeilany (Do you also notice my selfpropaganda right? :D *wink, wink*)
